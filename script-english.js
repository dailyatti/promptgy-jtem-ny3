        prompt: "Find today's football matches from all leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, MLS, Copa Libertadores, Championship, etc.), and review bookmakers for odds. Check other tipsters' opinions - only give tips that are today, and odds exceed 1.90. Think through your answer carefully and justify it in detail. Give both single and combo tips. Think like a sports betting professional who has been doing this for 20 years and specializes in football. Examine everything from team form to weather to missing players. Analyze teams' xG/xGA (Expected Goals) and xPTS (Expected Points) indicators, npxG (non-penalty xG) values, Big Chances Created/Conceded statistics, possession %, PPDA (passes per defensive action), progressive pass & carry numbers, deep completions, set piece efficiency, pressing intensity zones, defensive line height and field tilt ratio. Also pay attention to international cup matches, friendly matches and qualification matches. Think about which could be the best value bet with at least 50%+ probability. Don't forget: you are a professional who pays attention to everything, even things that bookmakers might not notice. Justify your answers well and write them in proper tip format at the end. Very important to review multiple groups and comments, especially those discussing betting value, and where multiple people see value bets - for example missing key player or other factor that escapes bookmakers' attention. The point: write the tips in tip format at the end.\n\nIMPORTANT: Format all betting tips in proper English tip format, ranked by EV (Expected Value) in descending order. Each tip must include: 1) Bet description 2) Bookmaker odds 3) Probability estimate (%) 4) EV calculation 5) Confidence level. Example: 'Max Verstappen Race Winner @2.10 | Probability: 58% | EV: +21.8% | High Confidence'",
