## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
If you want to pre-configure API keys (not recommended for security):

1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add variables (optional):
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

**Note:** The app is designed to work without these - users enter their own API keys.

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed

## 🔧 Build Settings

The project is configured for static deployment with these settings in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "."

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## 🌐 Live Site Features

Once deployed, your site will have:

- ✅ **Cherry-coded light theme** with animations

- ✅ **Professional betting analysis** with EV calculations

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Images not loading**
   - Verify HTTPS is enabled
